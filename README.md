This served as the programming part of the Option Forecasting Research coauthoered by Zheng Cao, Wenyu Du, and kirill V. Golubnichiy.

The authors applied numerical and ML approaches to forecast stock options and improved Quasi-Reversibility Method trading strategies,
implemented Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory Networks models to
generate new forecasting results through validation and testing, and achieved 59% profitable rates given millions of data.
The results were presented results at 25th URP (Seattle, 2022) and Computing Conference (London, 2023).
